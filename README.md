# project-tt-api-tests-framework

üî∏ A snippet of the framework - as a part of the portfolio - with automated tests created for TT.* project (web app for b2b segment; providing knowledge management and team collaboration tools)

üî∏ Includes selected tests that:
- validate API and database functionality integration on some of the key endpoints
- are generic for running both positive and negative test cases 
- are parametrized to run on multiple sets of data for comprehensive validation of action permissions based on different user roles
- do a full check of test results, from simple status code of response to all changes that are triggered by API call in PostgreSQL database connected 
- run in each regression testing cycle

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Before running tests the backend of the App could be built and deployed on local machine, as well as App's database (from the separate repository) 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To install all packages and modules used in the project, simply run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the Terminal of Pycharm.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To run all tests at once use the command "pytest tests" in the Terminal of Pycharm. Or use the command "pytest ./tests/[name_of_specific_file_with_test.py]" to run a specific test.
